		This research is being conducted by Jairo Souza, Rodrigo, Baldoino, Marcio, Bruno, Gustavo e Rohit.<br/><br/>

		We are researchers at EASY-GROUP studying how to developers recognizing information on bug introducing changes in practice.<br/><br/>

		One way to do this, Find out which information is most relevant to developers. To achieve this goal, we are are conducting this survey, and we would like to know your opinion about the main information you need to identify bug-introducing changes.<br/><br/>

		The estimated time to complete the questionnaire is 45 minutes.<br/><br/>

		If you have any doubt, do not hesitate to contact us in jrmcs@ic.ufal.br. <br/><br/>

		This study is about the perceptions and attitudes of developers to recognize information that helps to identify changes that introduce bugs during software development.<br/><br/>
		
		<b>WHAT IS A BUG-INTRODUCING CHANGE?</b><br/>

		During the process of development and evolution of software, inevitably, developers perform changes. These changes may introduce bugs, also known as bug-introducing changes[1].<br/><br/>
		
		Identifying which information is more relevant to detect bug-introducing changes may support developers and code reviewers during the process of bugs inspection.<br/><br/>
		
		The figure below helps to understand this context. It shows the entire process of a software development that contains bug-introducing changes. In this example, the developer introduces a bug, but it is not identified in the discussion and process review phase. Therefore the bug-introducing changes are merged in the main branch of software, which will be made available soon to clients.<br/>

		The identification of bugs during the software development helps to reduce the costs and efforts. Several studies [2,3,4] shows that is important to identify and fix bugs early in the software development to save time, efforts, and money. A real-world example of Identifying a bug after the development phase is the Samsung Note 7 fiasco that costs around 17 billion to the company [3].There was speculation that one of the problems the Note 7 phones was related to a bug in their battery management system that could lead the battery to overcharge, become unstable, and eventually explode.<br/><br/>
